# NextJS Awesome Starter.

A NextJS starter application that comes with Apollo, Styled Components, Dotenv, and ESLint.

## Requirements
- Node 8.1.2 or higher

## Development

First you `yarn install`

Then you `yarn start` and visit `http://localhost:4160`.

Then you do some work.

If you want to build your own version, just run `yarn build` and then I'd recommend deploying with `now`.
